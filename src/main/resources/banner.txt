* This is my program.  There are many programs   *
* like it but this one is mine.  My program is   *
* my best friend. It is my life. I must master   *
* it as I must master my life.  Without me, my   *
* program is useless. Without my program, I am   *
* useless. I must code my program true. I must   *
* code better than my competition who is trying  *
* to beat me.  I must release my program before  *
* he releases his.  I willâ€¦                      *
*                                                *
* Before Zod I swear this creed. My program and  *
* I are the leaders of our market. We are the    *
* masters of our competition. We are the saviors *
* of our customers. So be it, until victory is   *
* ours and there are no more bugs, only happy    *
* users.                                         *
